It is an attempt at replacing SmartGWT's use of Javadoc to denote "override point" classes, which are classes in the SmartGWT framework which have been deemed as "approved" to be overriden by framework
implementors.  The idea is to allow the Java compiler to issue warnings (or, optionally, errors), when a implementor overrides a framework class which is NOT approved as such.

The idea is to have the SmartGWT framework incorporate this annotation processor, and use the @OverridePoint annotation in classes that are currently denoted as such via Javadoc.
