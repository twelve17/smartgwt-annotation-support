It is an attempt at replacing SmartGWT's use of Javadoc to denote 
"override point" classes, which are classes in the SmartGWT framework which 
have been deemed as "approved" to be overriden by framework implementors.  

The processor allows the Java compiler to issue warnings (or, optionally, 
errors), when a implementor overrides a framework class which is NOT approved as such.

Implementation-wise, the ideal scenario would be to have the SmartGWT framework 
incorporate this annotation processor, and use the @OverridePoint annotation in 
classes that are currently denoted as such via Javadoc.
